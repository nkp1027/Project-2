Project 2
## Proposal
Our project is to train a logistic regression model to make trading predictions for NVIDIA. We will back test and compare to an SVM model. We will be adding new criteria for the buy and sell indicators using the TA library. These include RSI and Ichimoku cloud. Ichimoku cloud helps determine the direction, momentum and support-resistance levels. RSI is the relative strength index which is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The source of the data we will be using will be from YahooFinance.
